Managing Bundles
================

This document details the commands used to manage bundles.

Currently, all command bundles are executed on the same machine as the
Gort Controller. In `a future release <going-forward.html>`__, support for
"relays" will be added, which will allow commands to be executed on
different machines running a Relay process.

.. raw:: html

   <!-- All command bundles (with the exception of the embedded `gort` bundle) run under one or more Relay processes, which can be on the same machine as the Gort bot or on different machines.

   To learn more about bundles or relays check out the corresponding docs. -->

Prerequisites
-------------

For simplicity we will be using the ``gort`` command-line utility to
demonstrate bundle management. Bundle management mostly involves use of
the ``bundle`` subcommand. However, you aren't explicitly required to
use ``gort`` to manage bundles: you can use the ``!gort:bundle``
command, or you can even make calls directly to the API if you like.

The remainder of this page assumes that you have a working Gort
Controller and the ``gort`` utility.

Installing Bundles
------------------

Bundles are installed by uploading bundle configurations to Gort, which
then registers the bundle. Registration includes the creation of the
permissions declared by the bundle, as well as any default rules
specified in the bundle's metadata.

Importantly, after installation your bundle command will be available,
but may not be usable yet. Before anyone can execute the new commands,
make sure their user permissions are set properly. See :doc:`permissions-and-rules` to learn more.

Bundles are installed via the ``bundle install`` sub-command in
``gort``.

::

    $ gort bundle install --help
    Install a bundle from a bundle file.

    When using this command, you must provide the path to the file, as follows:

      gort bundle install /path/to/my/bundle/config.yaml

    Usage:
      gort bundle install [flags] config_path

    Flags:
      -h, --help   Show this message and exit

    Global Flags:
      -P, --profile string   The Gort profile within the config file to use

The Bundle Configuration File
-----------------------------

The only required argument for ``gort bundle install`` is the path to
the bundle's config file.

All bundles have a ``config`` file, a yaml-formatted document that
contains information for installing and executing commands in your
bundle. To learn more about configuration files take a look at `Bundle
Configurations <bundle-configurations>`__.

We won't discuss bundle configurations in detail here, but minimally
each must contain:

-  ``name`` - The name of your bundle.
-  ``version`` - The version of your bundle in semver format.
-  ``gort_bundle_version`` - The version of the config file format
   (currently only version 1 is used).
-  ``commands`` - A map of commands to be included in the bundle.

A minimal bundle config might look something like this:

::

    ---
    gort_bundle_version: 1

    name: my_bundle
    version: 0.0.1
    description: My bundle
    commands:
      date:
        executable: [ /bin/date ]
        rules:
          - allow

The command to install the bundle would be something like
``gort bundle install /path/to/my_bundle.yml``.

.. attention::
   Bundles are disabled when first installed. You must enable them before you can use them.

   <!-- ## Templates

   The templates flag points to a directory containing any templates for your bundle.

   Templates are used by Gort to format command output. They are singular to a specific command/adapter combo. So for example; if we wanted to support both HipChat and Slack for our date command, we would need to supply two templates.

   When added to the config file the templates section might look something like this:

   ---
   ...
   templates:
     date:
       body: |
         ~each var=$results~
         `~$item.date~`
         ~end~
   ...
   This works great for simple templates, but can get confusing when things start to get more complicated. To remedy that gort provides some helpers.

   If you store your templates in a directory, you'll need to pass the --templates option; gort does not infer this by default. The directory should contain one directory per adapter and each adapter directory should contain a mustache file for each command. So for our date command we would have something like this:

   $ tree templates
   templates
   └── date.greenbar
   Given a structure like this gort will automatically append all of the templates in the directory to your bundle config before uploading. -->

Enabling and Disabling Bundle Versions
--------------------------------------

When a new version of a bundle is installed, it's disabled by default.
Only one version can be enabled at a time and a version must be
explicitly enabled before Gort will use it to handle commands.

Enabling and disabling bundle versions is a straight-forward process.

For example, if you already have version 1.0.0 of "my-bundle" installed:

::

    $ go run . bundle versions my-bundle
    BUNDLE      VERSION    STATUS
    my-bundle   1.0.0      Enabled

You can install version 2.0.0 in a reasonably straight-forward manner:

::

    $ gort bundle install /path/to/my-bundle/v2/config.yaml
    $ gort bundle versions my-bundle
    BUNDLE      VERSION    STATUS
    my-bundle   1.0.0      Enabled
    my-bundle   2.0.0      Disabled

As always, a newly-installed bundle is disabled by default. At this
point, invoking any commands from the "my-bundle" bundle will still
execute from version 1.0.0.

::

    $ gort bundle info my-bundle
    Name: gort
    Versions: 1.0.0, 2.0.0
    Status: Enabled
    Enabled Version: 1.0.0
    Commands: date
    Permissions:

Switching to the new version is as simple as:

::

    $ gort bundle enable my-bundle 2.0.0
    $ gort bundle versions my-bundle
    BUNDLE      VERSION    STATUS
    my-bundle   1.0.0      Disabled
    my-bundle   2.0.0      Enabled

From now on, any "my-bundle" command invocations will execute from
version 2.0.0, using whatever access rules have been defined in that
version.

And if you decide you don't like version 2.0.0 for any reason, you can
always switch back to 1.0.0:

::

    $ gort bundle enable my-bundle 1.0.0
    $ gort bundle versions my-bundle
    BUNDLE      VERSION    STATUS
    my-bundle   1.0.0      Enabled
    my-bundle   2.0.0      Disabled

Assuming that you have the required access, you can also enable and
disable bundles using the ``gort:bundle`` chat command.

   <!-- ### Relay Groups
   Gort manages all of your command bundles and relays. Bundles are associated to relays via relay-groups. When a bundle is installed and assigned to a relay-group, Gort pushes the command config to the appropriate relay or relays. When a command is invoked, Gort uses the relay-group to select which relay is capable of running which command.

   Relay groups are managed through gort with the relay-group sub-command. For more information read up on Installing and Managing Relays.

   Optionally during bundle creation you can pass the --relay-group option multiple times.

   Bundles are assigned to relays via relay groups using gort.

   $ gort relay-group assign my_relay_group my_bundle
   Note

   The default refresh interval for a relay is 15 minutes (set in the relay configuration file - relay.conf). Be sure to wait for the specified amount time in order to see the bundle appear on the relays in the assigned relay group. -->

Uninstalling Bundles and Bundle Versions
----------------------------------------

You may uninstall a specific version of a bundle or all versions of a
bundle.

Uninstalling a specific version will remove rules and permissions only
associated with that version. Uninstalling all bundle versions involves
complete removal of all authorization rules governing its commands as
well as deletion of all the bundle's permissions. You can re-install to
restore the bundle permissions and rules. If you only wish to disable a
bundle, see "Enabling and Disabling Bundle Versions" above.

Uninstalling a bundle requires the use of the ``gort bundle uninstall``
subcommand.

::

    $ gort bundle uninstall --help
    Uninstall bundles.

    Usage:
      gort bundle uninstall [flags] bundle_name version

    Flags:
      -c, --clean         Uninstall all disabled bundle versions
      -x, --incompatible  Uninstall all incompatible versions of the bundle
      -a, --all           Uninstall all versions of the bundle
      --help              Show this message and exit.

    Global Flags:
      -P, --profile string   The Gort profile within the config file to use

Uninstalling a bundle version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Importantly, enabled bundles cannot be uninstalled.

::

    $ gort bundle uninstall date 0.1.0
    Usage: gort bundle uninstall [OPTIONS] NAME [VERSION]

    Error: Invalid value for "version": Cannot uninstall enabled version. Please disable the bundle first

Before any bundle can be uninstalled, it must first be disabled.

::

    $ gort bundle disable my_bundle 0.1.0
    $ gort bundle uninstall my_bundle 0.1.0
    Uninstalled my_bundle 0.1.0

Uninstalling all versions of a bundle
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since uninstalling all versions of a bundle can be very destructive, you
must pass the ``--all`` flag to ``gort``, or your request will fail.

::

    $ gort bundle uninstall date
    Error: Can't uninstall without specifying a version, or --incompatible, --all, --clean

It would seem that ``gort bundle uninstall`` needs either a version
number, or an ``--all`` flag.

::

    $ gort bundle uninstall date --all
    Usage: gort bundle uninstall [OPTIONS] NAME [VERSION]

    Error: date 0.1.0 is currently enabled. Please disable the bundle first.

This time the uninstallation failed because the bundle is still enabled.

::

    $ gort bundle disable date
    Disabled date

    $ gort bundle uninstall date --all
    Uninstalled date 0.0.1
    Uninstalled date 0.0.1
    Uninstalled date 0.1.0

Success at last.
