# The Gort Guide

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gort-guide/badge/?version=latest)](https://guide.getgort.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

User documentation for the [Gort](https://github.com/getgort/gort) chatbot framework.

## File Format

This documentation uses [reStructuredText](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText) (ReST), a lightweight markup language designed to be both processable by documentation-processing software such as Docutils, and easily readable by human programmers. We chose this format because it's more fully-featured than markdown, but similar enough that the learning curve is reasonably low.

## How To Contribute

Did you find an error? Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/getgort/gort-guide/issues)! If you're really bold, you may even clone the repo and create a PR!

The documentation source files live in the [`/guide/source/sections`](https://github.com/getgort/gort-guide/tree/main/guide/source/sections) directory as `.rst` files. Changes to the source files will be automatically applied when they're merged into main and should be visible at [guide.getgort.io](https://guide.getgort.io) with a few minutes.
